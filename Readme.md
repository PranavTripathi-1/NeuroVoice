# 🎙️ NeuroVoice - AI-Powered Speech Emotion Detection

## 📌 Overview
NeuroVoice is an AI-powered application that detects emotions in speech using deep learning.  
It allows users to **upload** or **record** their voice, then instantly analyzes it to identify emotions like **Happy**, **Sad**, **Neutral**, and **Angry**.

This project uses **Python, TensorFlow, Librosa, and Streamlit** to create a simple yet powerful speech emotion detection system.
